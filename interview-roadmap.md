# Interview Roadmap: Acing Full-stack Interviews

Preparing for full-stack interviews requires a blend of technical knowledge, problem-solving skills, and behavioral aptitude. This document provides guidance and common areas to focus on.

### 2.1. Core Interview Areas

* **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA):**
    * **Fundamentals:** Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables.
    * **Algorithms:** Sorting (Quick, Merge), Searching (Binary), Recursion, Dynamic Programming.
    * **Practice:** LeetCode (Easy/Medium), HackerRank.
* **Frontend Fundamentals:**
    * Deep understanding of HTML, CSS (Box Model, Flexbox, Grid, Responsiveness).
    * JavaScript (closures, prototypes, event loop, `this` context, async JS).
    * DOM manipulation, browser APIs, web performance optimization.
    * Framework-specific questions (React hooks, component lifecycle, state management).
* **Backend Fundamentals:**
    * HTTP methods, RESTful principles, API design best practices.
    * Database concepts (SQL vs. NoSQL, normalization, indexing, ACID properties).
    * Authentication & Authorization flows (JWT, OAuth, sessions).
    * Concurrency, error handling, logging.
    * Framework-specific questions (.NET Core Middleware, Node.js event loop, Django ORM).
* **System Design:**
    * **Scalability:** Horizontal vs. Vertical scaling, load balancing, caching.
    * **Reliability:** Redundancy, fault tolerance, distributed systems.
    * **Database Design:** Choosing the right database, schema design.
    * **Microservices vs. Monoliths:** Trade-offs.
    * **Communication:** REST vs. gRPC vs. GraphQL.
    * **Common patterns:** Message queues, service discovery.
* **DevOps & Deployment Basics:**
    * Git workflow (branching strategies, PR reviews).
    * CI/CD pipelines, Docker, basic cloud concepts (AWS, Azure, GCP).
* **Behavioral Questions:**
    * Teamwork, conflict resolution, dealing with failure, learning from mistakes.
    * "Tell me about a time when...", "Why full-stack?", "Why our company?".

### 2.2. Interview Preparation Strategies

* **Targeted Practice:** Focus your DSA practice on common patterns.
* **Deepen Foundational Knowledge:** Revisit HTML, CSS, JavaScript basics â€“ many interviews start here.
* **Build & Document Projects:** Have a few well-documented, ideally full-stack, projects to discuss in detail. Be ready to explain your choices and challenges.
* **Mock Interviews:** Practice with peers, mentors, or platforms like Pramp/Interviewing.io.
* **Research the Company & Role:** Understand their tech stack and what they look for.
* **STAR Method:** Use the **S**ituation, **T**ask, **A**ction, **R**esult method for behavioral questions.
* **Ask Questions:** Always have intelligent questions to ask the interviewer about the role, team, or company.
